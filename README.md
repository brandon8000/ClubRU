# Club RU

Club RU is a Club Penguin inspired MMO, specifically for Rutgers students.

## To Contributors

We will be using the standard pull-request workflow for development. If you're
unfamiliar with this work flow read [Understanding the Github Flow]
(https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) (very short read). If you're
unfamiliar with git, please read one of the many
[great online git turorials](https://www.google.com/#q=git+tutorial)
or seek help from someone in the CAVE. You may send pull requests from forked
repositories or work off branches in the main repository. Open an issue if you
need write access to the repo.

If you are in the "Club Rutgers" group in COGS, start by adding your name to
`package.json` in contributors. This may involve referencing the
[official npm documentation](https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json).
Second, make sure you understand the basic technologies we will be using for
this project. Knowledge of HTML and CSS or other web development knowledge will
be helpful, but is not required. Knowledge of specific libraries or frameworks
such as NodeJS, SocketIO or PixiJSv4 may be required for certain subgroups but
can easily be learned as you make contributions. Knowledge of basic Javascript
for any programming aspect is necessary to work on this project. Alternatively,
art and music contributions are also encouraged.

If you do not know javascript or would like to refresh your knowledge, I
recommend [Mozilla's Javascript Guide]
(https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide) The
*Introduction* (ignore Web Console stuff), *Grammar and types*, *Control flow
and error handling*, *Loops and iteration*, *Functions* and *Details of the
object model* should easily be enough to get you started writing Javascript.
Javascript is an important language and you will not regret learning it.

## Dependencies

Club RU requires NodeJS v7.5.0 or above (or compatible alternative, such as
iojs) with npm to handle libraries. Use the below commands to run.

    $ npm install
    $ node clubru.js
